sorting based on sal or id --look in to Treeset and compareable and comparator interface
sortArrayByFrequency --multiple  loops for each,for  and while also converting map to list (we can go for only map and sort the map)
Singleton missing -just one class do this serilizable,clone (thread safe double locking is missing)
producer and consumer try with synchronized key word(wait,notify)
PairWithSum need to improve the method so that it will return all pairs(like in a list or array)
ImmutableClass --try to add one list field 
LeastOccurance --check without jdk8 features
FirstDuplicate -- once founnd break the loop and return the 1st duplicate instead of looping upto n
