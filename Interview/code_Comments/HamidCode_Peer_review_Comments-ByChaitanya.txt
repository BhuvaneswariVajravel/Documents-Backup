1. IntArrayGetTargetPairIndices  - using n*n time complexity try with hashset/hashmap
2. Palindrome -  can use with simple way with while loop and using start and end of the character to compare which will ne less than o(n) complexity
3. PushZero to left - need to work on this. Push to left looks fine
4. Singleton -  code is missing
5. find duplicates - having o(n*n) need to reduce the time complexity, we use the hashset and try , using  streams looks fine
6. need to try the 
	Custom HashMap
	count Islands in 2d matrix
